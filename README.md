**Game is too big to push to git, so to anyone interested, contact me via e-mail and I'll share link to drive with executable version.** 
# Octavio
2D platformer videogame developed as part of final thesis for university undergraduate study of computer science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Split.

## Idea?
Idea was to make 2D platformer videogame based on music. There are 8 levels in a game, each level is made from 8 more sub-levels. As the player makes progress through the game, the game gets more and more challenging. At the same time, level music gets more and more complicated, thereby creating the feeling of progress.

## Frameworks used
Game was made using primarily **Unreal Engine**. I aslo used: 
- Gimp
- FL Studio 2020
