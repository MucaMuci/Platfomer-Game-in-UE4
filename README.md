Završni rad za preddiplomski studij Računarstva na Fakultetu Elektrotehnike Strojarstva i Brodogradnje.

## Idea?
Idea was to make 2D platformer videogame based on music. There are 8 levels in a game, each level is made from 8 more sub-levels. As the player makes progress through the game, the game gets more and more challenging. At the same time, level music gets more and more complicated, thereby creating the feeling of progress.

## Frameworks used
Game was made using primarily **Unreal Engine**. I aslo used: 
- Gimp
- FL Studio 2020
